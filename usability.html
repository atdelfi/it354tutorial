            <h2>Availability and Accessibility</h2>
            <p>It is very important to insure your host for you website is trusted and allows the user to connect to it in a realitively speed time. Insure that all links work and do not throw errors at the user. And lastly make sure that your website is mobile friendly as that is how almost all people would be viewing your website at some point. The articles website example is Amazon as it checks all the requirements and encourages users to give feedback for accessibility</p>
            <h2>Clarity</h2> 
            <p>This is one of the cores of making a cohisive website as if its not clear what to do you can would confuse the user. You want to have your website be simplistic, familiar, consistent, have some guidance, direct feedback, and have good information architecture. <br> It seems pretty obvious to have a clear website but what might be clear to you is some new experience the user has never experienced before and can confuse them. You also shouldn't be redesigning your website every few months as change is often off putting to users. <br> Apple is their example a clear website as it checks all the check boxes for a clear website.</p>
            <h2>Learnability</h2>
            <p>This is another important aspect of web design as your goal is to create intutive interface that don't require instructions or a long trial and error period to have them figure your webpage out. <br> Their choice is Microsoft as they have their logo in the top right, search bar in the top left, their nav bar under those and under those intutive design to find what you are looking for</p>
            <h2>Credibility</h2>
            <p>This allows you to give your site the ability to gain the users trust as if you don't seem credible why would they believe the content on your site. A major fix to this to have a about us page that gives your contact info and having a design to match what you are trying to sell. <br> Their pick is L'OREAL as they have a great about us page and their design matches the eligance of what they are selling. And having a Research and Innovatoin page is a major boost aswell.</p>
            <h2>Relevancy</h2>
            <p>The final aspect is relevancy as it is important to know your users and why they are at your site. For example if you are a car dealership and are promoting McDonalds as your landing page, its not relevant to your users.
                <br> Their pick is Nike as they have the 3 sections for their users as male, female, and children. And even further categories to help the user find the pair of shoes they are looking for.
