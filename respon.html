            <h2>Responsive website video review</h2>
            <p> <a href="responsive/index.html">Link to website</a><br> <h2>Likes</h2>I really enjoyed learning more of the emmit shorthand, for example, I didn't know that you could just type img and hit tab and it creates the img tag.
                I also liked learning about the display flex as it seems easier than having to mess around with bootstraps grids.
                Also very cool to learn to attach a gradient to text with the webkits.
                I found it was very helpful to see the media at a certain to change instead of using bootstrap to either show or dont show the area. <br> 
                <h2>Dislikes</h2> I think the only things I didn't like in his video is that he typed a bit to fast for the video, with me having to pause or go back a bit to catch up. And the other is not exactly having to see his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1GDVMAwdN4">"Laptob Web UI Design Tutorial for Beginners "</a> to understand what he was doing as he was doing it. But in the whole scheme of things that is pretty minor.
