            <h2>Issues to be wary of </h2>
            <p><h3>Pop ups</h3>
                Having an ad wall or having a pop up to have the user sign up for this servies interups their session and could cause them to leave the site.
                <h3>Change the users' window size</h3>
                This is seems pretty obvious as it should be your job to make the site accessibile on any size window and it is insulting for the user to be told they are using their servies wrong and you know better.
                <h3>Small Font size</h3>
                This is important not to do as having small font size will inconvience the user and have to either zoom in on the site or look for a site that has the same information that they can read without having to change their zoom size.
                <h3>Unclear Links</h3>
                This should be clear to have links for things you are describing and be clear that to the user what the link is. Not links to random things those should be avoided at all cost.
                <h3>Dead links</h3>
                Make sure your links work and don't cause 404 errors.
                <h3>Animations</h3>
                Do not over fill your site with animations as they are very destracting if multiple things are blinking. One is generally the most you should use and if it an animated ad make sure they are at the top so the user can scroll down and not be destracted by it.
                <h3>Contact Info</h3>
                Making a website it should be easy to have the user contact you, especially for online stores as the user can have worries of a product and not having the info can cause mistrust and a lost customer.
                <h3>Opening windows</h3>
                Do not assume the user wants to have a new window open for links on your page. If they want it on a different page they will and if not they want it on the same window.
                <h3>Banner Blindness</h3>
                The users are very good at finding the information on a page and only focusing on that and ignoring the ads on the banner.
                <h3>The law of similarty</h3>
                This is that elements that are similar will be perseved as the same and be grouped together.
